In most vehicle checkpoints, the entry process for guests, staff and others making visit to the area
involves a security personnel who confirms the entry details by checking the identification document. This process has high probability that it might incorporate human errors during the confirmation and registration process, since this is a manual process. Writing on register and manually entering the entry and exit data can be tiring and time consuming job for a security personnel at the check point. As, the information entered is in hard copy, it is difficult to share. Thus we need an automatic system, which will reduce manual entry process and minimize the security personal effort. When a vehicle reaches the vicinity of the check point ,the security personnel can scan the vehicle number plate and the drivers face and verify their identity from the database and will also store the information.
Through this system, security and authorized personnel will be able to keep track of vehicle movement along with its drivers information. The proposed solution will reduce check-in check-out time while implying other added benefits in terms of parking management and traffic monitoring.
